Preamble
--------

This program allows you to play a game of 20 Questions with another user over
a network, or on the same computer.


Compilation Command
-------------------

Run the following command in the root directory of the files:

  make

Run the following command to clear the generated build and runtime files:

  make clean


Launching and Operating Instructions
------------------------------------

Run the program with the following command to start as the Oracle. A Guesser
connects to you:

  ./a5

Run the program with the following command to start as the Guesser. You connect
to the Oracle by filling in the IP address (Default port is 60002):

  ./a5 ip
  
Run the program with the following command to start as the Oracle. You connect
to the Oracle by filling in the IP address and port:

  ./a5 ip port

When a user is the Guesser, they have 20
questions to ask the Oracle to try and find out the thing that the Oracle knows.
When a user is the Oracle, they receive the Guesser's questions and either press
Ctrl-C for an answer that is leading in the right direction, press Ctrl-Z for a
wrong guess or press Ctrl-\ for a correct/winner response. The game ends (or
continues) when either the Guesser runs out of their 20 guesses, or the guesser
correctly guesses what the Oracle knows. The winner then gets to decide whether
to continue playing the game (as the Oracle) or quit the game.




Bonus Features
