           Jonathan Simpson ***REMOVED*** - COMP 2401 A - Assignment 1
              
*******************************************************************************


Preamble
--------

This program/assignment is a single file. the a1Defs.h and ciphertext.txt file
are hardcoded into the a1.c file. The program takes the hardcoded ciphertext and
decrypts it, outputting the cleartext to standard out.


More Functionality
------------------

An attempt was made to include command line arguments, but at the last moment
the author unfortunately realized that the parser of command line arguments
parses by digit and not by number. The code and accompanying functions for this
is still included. 


Compilation Command
-------------------

gcc -std=c99 -o a1 a1.c


Launching and Operating Instructions
------------------------------------

No user input needed. Just run the program.

eg: ./a1
