Preamble
--------

This program asks the user to input up to 100 integers to then find the sum of
it all either via recursion or iteration. The function call stack is implemented
as a linked list. The function call stack is written to a file named
"a3output.txt" (lame .txt extension), then exits.


Compilation Command
-------------------

  gcc -o a3 a3.c a3loop.c a3Stack.c


Launching and Operating Instructions
------------------------------------

Run the program with the following command:

  ./a3

Input up to 100 integers, each integer followed by a newline (return key). Enter
either the 'r' character or 'i' character to find the sum of the entered
integers using recursive or iterative summation, respectively. The sum is
displayed in stdout while the function call stack is written to a3output.txt in
the running directory of a3.


Bonus Features
--------------

  - Added different return values for errors that occur in the program
