Preamble
--------

This program manages a database of movies using a doubly-linked list. The user
is presented a menu to select a slew of operations (add, delete, view,
search-view, exit). Adding a movie requires entering the name, year and genre of
the movie. Movies are sorted in chronological order based on title. If there
are two or more movies with the same title then the matching movies are
sorted by chronologically by their year.


Compilation Command
-------------------

Run the following command in the root directory of the files:

  make

Run the following command to clear the generated build and runtime files:

make clean


Launching and Operating Instructions
------------------------------------

Run the program with the following command:

  ./a4

Adding a single or multiple movies to the database is done by entering 1 from
the main menu, entering in how many movies you would like to add, then entering
in the respective title, year and genre for each movie.

Delete a movie that is in the database by entering 2 for "Delete a movie", then
entering the full title of the movie to delete.

Display all of the movies currently in the database by entering 3 for "List all
movies" from the main menu.

List all movies of a specific genre by entering 4 at the main menu for "List all
movies by genre" and then entering the respective genre you are interested
in showing.

Exit the program by entering 0 for "Quit" at the main menu.

A view of the doubly-linked list at various steps in the program is outputted
to "a4output.txt" in the root directory.
